  ### Code example:
*Create a function which answers the question "Are you playing banjo?".*
If your name starts with the letter "R" or lower case "r", you are playing banjo!
The function takes a name as its only argument, and returns one of the following strings:\
name + " plays banjo" \
name + " does not play banjo"
```
function areYouPlayingBanjo(name) {
  return name.substring(0,1).toLowerCase() === "r" ? `${name} plays banjo` : `${name} does not play banjo`;
}
```
